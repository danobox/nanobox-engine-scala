# Scala

This is a generic Java engine used to launch [Nanobox](http://nanobox.io).

##### NOTE: This Engine is a Work in Progress
If you're interested in helping to complete this engine, answers to the questions in [this issue](https://github.com/nanobox-io/nanobox-engine-scala/issues/2) would be great.*

## App Detection
To detect a Scala app, this engine checks for one of the following:

- Files with the `.sbt` extenstion
- Files with the `.scala` extension inside the `project` directory
- Files with the `.scala` extension inside the `.sbt` directory
- `project/build.properties`


## Basic Configuration Options

This engine exposes configuration options through the [Boxfile](http://docs.nanobox.io/boxfile/), a yaml config file used to provision and configure your app's infrastructure when using Nanobox. 


#### Overview of Basic Boxfile Configuration Options
```yaml
build:
  # Java Settings
  java_runtime: sun-jdk8
```

---

### Java Settings
The following setting allows you to define your Java runtime environment.

---

#### java_runtime
Specifies which Java runtime and version to use. The following runtimes are available:

- openjdk7
